# Fooyes ( Food Ordering Website )
Welcome to the Food Ordering Website project! Fooyes Website created with React.js, Redux, HTML, and Bootstrap for ordering food online. The website includes features such as user authentication, a home page with a Top restaurant list, Restaurant listing and detail pages, an order page with checkout details, and a shopping cart.
I bought a Fooyes template and converted it from HTML Bootstrap into React js

Under Development (Updates In progress...)

## Features
- **Location Page**: Get the user's location to show a restaurant based on the user's location

- **Home Page**: The home page includes popular categories, top-rated restaurants, and an image banner for delivery.

- **Restaurant Page**: Each restaurant has its page with a list of foods related to that restaurant and it contains a veg / pure-veg filter.

- **Restaurant Detail Page**: Clicking on a restaurant in a restaurant list page navigates the user to a detailed page about that specific restaurant. it contains   
   a cart on the right side. also, this page is implemented with redux, allowing users to perform the following action:
  - Add items to the cart
  - Delete items from the cart
  - Clear the entire cart
  - Adjust item quantities with a responsive total
  
- **Order Page (Redux)**: The order page is combined with checkout and cart. in checkout for now user only selects the order with cash option. in the future, I will implement credit card payment

- **Contact Page**: This page includes a form and static map
